# Status Light™
Status Light™ is a collection of tools and concepts for light-weight summary displays of multiple status signals, similar to status lights.

[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sgrottel/status-light)](./LICENSE)

It's goal is to provide a simple and easy overview, like "All is Ok," or "There is something wrong."
It's not aiming to provide detailed status information.
It can defer to other sources for that.

## Status Signals
A status signal is information of one source about it's status.
A source typically is a service, a machine, a device, or a sensor.

Status is defined as:

0. ⚫ Black  -- usually meaning there is no information
1. ⚪ Grey  -- usually meaning there is unspecific or neutral information available
2. 🟢 Green  -- usually meaning the source is all ok 
3. 🟡 Yellow  -- usually meaning the source is in an unchecked warning state
4. 🔴 Red  -- usually meaning the source is in an error state.

Meanings of the different colors might vary for different sources.

Status signals information is assumed to be pushed into the service's storage by the sources.
This project's implementations usually will not pull and collect information.

When evaluating a signals status, the time the last status signal event was pushed into the storage is important as well.
Missing status signal events can change the reported status from the last pushed status, e.g. when a device is not longer sending in status, it's signal can change to yellow (a warning) or red (an error), to call for attention and investigation.

## Alternatives
This project is specifically aiming for the minimal display use case in small to medium-scale scenarios.
It might not be what you are looking for.
There are many alternatives to consider:

* [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)
* [SolarWinds Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/)
* [Microsoft Azure Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs)
* [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs)
* etc.
